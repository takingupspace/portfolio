That knowledge gained from front-end styling evolved into  an interest in learning a programming language. First, I delved into JavaScript and that led to an exploration of Java. My " +
        "interest in Java led me to pursue a deeper level of understanding of object-oriented design. This eventually guided my desire to learn toward the lowest level of fundamentals for software development. I decided to " +
        "enroll in the Computer Science program in that same year, which eventually led me to the University of Texas at San Antonio. My time at UTSA gave me the opportunity to pursue my passions and fully explore the sub-domains under the technological umbrella " +
